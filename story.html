<div class="story-body animate-on-scroll">
  <p>It started with a truck and a question: what if you could roast coffee wherever you parked? The original idea was a roaster in the bed of an electric truck, powered by the truck itself. The truck was red, and the name stuck.</p>

  <p>Truck-bed roasting was a great idea right up until it wasn't. Consistency matters when people are trusting you with their morning, and that's hard to control in a parking lot. So the roasting moved indoors. The spirit didn't.</p>

  <blockquote class="story-pullquote-block">The roasting moved indoors. The spirit didn't.</blockquote>

  <p>That move shaped how we still work: small batches, single origins, and a lot of time at events where people will tell you exactly what they think of your coffee.</p>

  <div class="story-body-divider"></div>

  <h3>What we roast.</h3>

  <p>Single origin coffee from farming cooperatives around the world. We roast for clarity and sweetness, not dark-roast uniformity.</p>

  <p>Every lot gets cupped repeatedly and dialed in so the same bag works in a pour-over at home and a camp setup at 7,000 feet.</p>

  <blockquote class="story-pullquote-block">We roast for clarity and sweetness. Not dark-roast uniformity.</blockquote>

  <div class="story-body-divider"></div>

  <h3>Where you'll find us.</h3>

  <p>Red Canyon is the exclusive coffee roaster for all <a href="rangeway.html" style="color: var(--red); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">Rangeway Basecamps</a>. Roasted on site, brewed fresh, with bags to take home.</p>

  <p>Outside Basecamps, we show up at EV owners events. That's where coffee decisions get made: real people, real feedback, no tasting room pretense.</p>

  <div class="story-body-divider"></div>

  <h3>Why it matters.</h3>

  <p>The coffee market has enough noise. We keep it simple: know where it's from, make it taste good, don't overcomplicate the rest.</p>

  <blockquote class="story-pullquote-block">If it doesn't stand out in the cup, it doesn't stay in rotation.</blockquote>

  <p>We built this for people who care about the route as much as the destination. Disciplined, practical, and still open to detours.</p>
